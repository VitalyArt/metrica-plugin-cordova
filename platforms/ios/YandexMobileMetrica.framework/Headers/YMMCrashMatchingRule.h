/** Container with rules for crash matching.

 AppMetrica SDK collects symbols (addresses) of methods of classes declared in this rule, in runtime,
 once per application build. If a crash report contains any collected symbol, it will be sent to the 
 reporter registered this rule for crash matching. AppMetrica SDK symbolicates crash symbols extracted 
 with this rule.

 "False-positive" crash matching is not allowed, but "false-negative" is. It means that crash in the class 
 declared in this rule may not be matched, but every matched crash contains a method of some declared class 
 in the crashed thread stacktrace.

 Additionally, names of dynamic framework binaries could be provided to match crashes. Symbolication for this
 type of matching is not guaranteed, but accuracy is much greater. Collisions are possible only if there are
 more than one dynamic framework with the same name what is pretty unlikely.

 Correct matching of system classes and their extensions is not guaranteed.
